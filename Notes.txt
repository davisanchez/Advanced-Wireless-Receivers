First read chapter in the book
Write constraints and chosen parameters on top of the block diagram
172 bits somewhere
Discuss it with Orion


Combine CDMA and Convolutional codes, no additions
Not think of MIMO before finishing and perfectly working part 1
Start basic and then add on top
No need to stick to all details, start functionnal first

Office hours every friday,
Finish first part by next friday 

Interleaver would not add anything first as we already use random sequence
Same for deep fadings



Communication at 172 bits : p.350 (Voice compression)
Noise and correlation : Start of page 352, 355 just before Multiaccess
6-64 allows a reduction in error probability ? p. 353-354
Different users use a different phase of the PN sequence -> uncorrelated (p.356)
